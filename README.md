# simple-todo
Wanted a simple but (eventually) versatile todo app that I could iteratively customize as I used it. 

To be honest, I've scripted this one as an excuse to have a (totally productive) break.

Used Python for simplicity.
Design is stale at best. 
Code is terrible.

Use at your own risk.
